# League of Legends SoloQ Simulator
A simple program which calculates your League of Legends rank based on your rank, winrate, and the amount of games you want to play. Features typing in your riot id, a button and more! 

You need a riot api key from Riot Developer Portal in a .env file to make typing in your username work.

.exe file was made just for learning purposes, it doesnt include the "username_check()" functionality.

# To do:
- ~~Option to put in riot id instead of rank~~ (done)
- ~~Main loop optimization~~ (done)
- ~~Convert to .exe~~ (done)


# A gif showing how it works:
